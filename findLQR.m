function [K1, K2, K3] = findLQR(p,v0, lag1,lag2)

%findLQR is modified from the file in Matlab-Optimization-master
%lqr_BC_optimizer.m, and operates very similarly. It is modified in that it
%takes in arguments for the bicycle parameters (p), initial velocity (v0)
%and two different delays in operation (see runBicycleTestR/findOffset). 
%operates by tuning several different proportions of a gain matrix,
%computing a controller with the LQR algorithm, and then selecting 3
%successful controllers: K1 is the controller with the best balance score,
%and K2, K3 are both randomly selected for comparison.
